        <h2>Issues I have faced</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Completing a PGCE;</li>
            <ul>
                <li>It's like being a teacher, except you overplan everything, you aren't prepared for what lies ahead and crying in front of colleagues/friends is the norm.</li>
                <li>I overcame this by accepting that nervous breakdowns were just part of my life for the next 12 months, and that it would be worth it in the long run.</li>
                <li>Afterwards I went onto a successful career in teaching.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Being a boarding master;</li>
            <ul>
                <li>It's like being a parent, except you are only contractually obliged to put up with their nonsense, there are 50 of them and you get none of the redeeming features of parenthood.</li>
                <li>I overcame this difficulty by working harder, but caring less about assh*le kids.</li>
                <li>Afterwards I had a new sense of what a long, hard day felt like.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Having a child;</li>
            <ul>
                <li>It's like being alive, except the stuff you cared about is suddenly less important and having excrement on you is not a big deal anymore. And also, colic.</li>
                <li>I overcame it by sleeping when I could and supplying foot rubs and hugs to my wife when she needed them.</li>
                <li>Afterwards I had a completely new set of priorities and expectations from my life.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
